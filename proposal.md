# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Jump Stars or Speed Jump.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

2D platformer using Lua. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a 2D platform with a score systmem similar to Mario or Sonic. I was planning to do a top down mini dungeon crawler like a Link to the Past but that might be too much work.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not planning too

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I will work on this project on my own.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make sure that the game is able to run and that the sprite I'm using as a character is able move around and Jump.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will make sure to complete all my ideas with the score system and the timer. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I'm able to perfectly finsh my game with everything working well. No coding issues, no sprites, no bugs, just hoping for the best case scenario.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have to learn the bases of Lua to work on my final project.
